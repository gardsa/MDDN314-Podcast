          Join Samantha Gard and James Erwin as they discuss the work and ideas of Brian Eno, a man known as the Godfather of ambient music. Eno has held many titles in the creative industry - composer, visual artist, and record producer to name a few. With a focus on his audio-visual installation <i>77 Million Paintings</i>, Sam and James delve into the art of procedural generation, a number of Eno's personal philosophies, and the relevance of his work in contemporary media design. They also detail how his audio-visual projects have influenced their own design practice and ideologies, as well as how he paved the way for generative visual and sound design.
